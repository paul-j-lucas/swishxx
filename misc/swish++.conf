#	SWISH++
#	swish++.conf
#
#	This is a template configuration file.  It contains every configuration
#	variable, lists which executable(s) it's used with, and gives a brief
#	explanation.  Use this as a starting point for your own configuration
#	file.
#
#	Notes:
#	------
#
#	1. Sets of values are separated by whitespace.
#
#	2. The same variable may be specified on more than one line.  For sets,
#	   the value is the union of all the values; for all others, the value
#	   is the last value specified.
#
#	3. There is a special "infinity" numeric value.
#
#	4. Boolean values are one of: true, t, false, f, yes, y, no, n.  Case
#	   is irrelevant.
#
#	5. COMMENTS ARE TREATED AS SUCH ONLY IF THEY ARE ON LINES BY
#	   THEMSELVES!

#
#	For HTML and XHTML files, the values of meta NAME attributes for which
#	the words in the values of the associated CONTENT attribute should be
#	indexed or not indexed, respectively.

#	
#	By default, for IncludeMeta, words for all meta names are indexed.
#	Specifying at least one meta name via IncludeMeta changes that so that
#	only the words associated with a member of the set of meta names
#	explicitly specified are indexed.
#
#	If you're indexing MP3 files, it is recommended that you use the
#	IncludeMeta values as given above.  If you're indexing mail or news
#	files, it is recommended that you use the IncludeMeta values as given

#
#	The initial number of files to reserve space for.  During indexing,
#	this can be exceeded without any problem, but there will be a slight
#	performance penalty.
#
#	If you know approximately how many files you have, modify the above
#	value!

#IncludeFile RTF	*.rtf
#
# used by: index; same as the -e option.
#
#	A set of filename patterns of files to index and the modules they map
#	to.  Case is irrelevant for the module name but significant for the
#	patterns.  Filename patterns specified here MUST NOT also be specified
#	in ExcludeFile.
#
#	You should modify the set to include only those that you are actually
#	using for increased performance.

#Incremental		no
#
# used by: index; when "yes", same as the -I option.
#
#	When "yes", incrementally index files and add them to an existing
#	index.

#IndexFile		swish++.index
#
# used by: index, search; same as the -i option.
#
#	The name of the index file either generated or searched.

#LaunchdCooperation	no
#
# used by: search; same as the -l option
#
#	If "search" is run as a daemon, cooperate with Mac OS X's launchd(8) by
#	not "daemonizing" itself since launchd handles that.  When "yes", this
#	forces "SearchBackground no".
#
#	This option is available only under Mac OS X, should be used only for
#	version 10.4 (Tiger) or later, and only when search will be started via
#	launchd.

#PidFile			/var/run/search.pid
#
# used by: search; same as the -P option
#
#	If "search" is run as a daemon, record its process ID in this file.

#RecurseSubdirs		yes
#
# used by: index, extract; when "no", same as the -r option.
#
#	When "no", do not recursively index the files in subdirectories, that
#	is when a directory is encountered, all the files in that directory are
#	indexed (modulo the filename patterns specified via the IncludeFile,
#	ExcludeFile, or ExtractFile variables), but subdirectories encountered
#	are ignored and therefore the files contained in them are not indexed.
#	(This variable is most useful when specifying the directories and files
#	via standard input.)  The default is to index the files in
#	subdirectories recursively.

#ResultsMax		100
#
# used by: search; same as the -m option.
#
#	The maximum number of results to return overriding the compiled-in
#	default (which is usually 100).

#ResultSeparator	" "
#
# used by: search; same as the -R option
#
#	The string to separate the parts in a search result when ResultsFormat
#	is "classic".  Either single or double quotes can be used to preserve
#	whitespace.  Quotes are stripped only if they match.

#ResultsFormat		classic
#
# used by: search; same as the -F option
#
#	The output format of search results: either "classic" or "XML".

#SearchBackground	yes
#
# used by: search; when "no", same as the -B option.
#
#	When "yes" and SearchDaemon is not "none", automatically detach from
#	the terminal and run in the background.
#
#	This option is overridden by "LaunchdCooperation yes".

#SearchDaemon		none
#
# used by: search; same as the -b option.
#
#	When not "none", run "search" as a daemon process listening to either a
#	Unix domain ("unix") or TCP socket ("tcp") or both ("both") for
#	requests.

#SocketAddress		*:1967
#
# used by: search; same as the -a option.
#
#	Default IP address and port of the TCP socket; used only when
#	SearchDaemon  is either "tcp" or "both".

#SocketFile		/tmp/search.socket
#
# used by: search; same as the -u option.
#
#	Default name of the Unix domain socket file; used only when
#	SearchDaemon is either "unix" or "both".

#SocketQueueSize		511
#
# used by: search; same as the -q option.
#
#	Maximum number of queued connections for a socket; used only when
#	SearchDaemon is not "none".  The default 511 value is taken from
#	httpd.h in Apache:
#
#		It defaults to 511 instead of 512 because some systems store it
#		as an 8-bit datatype; 512 truncated to 8-bits is 0, while 511
#		is 255 when truncated.
#
#	If it's good enough for Apache, it's good enough for us.

#SocketTimeout		10
#
# used by search; same as the -o option.
#
#	Number of seconds a client has to complete a search request before
#	being disconnected.  This is to prevent a client from connecting, not
#	completing a request, and causing the thread servicing the request to
#	wait forever.  This is used only when SearchDaemon is not "none".

#StemWords		no
#
# used by: search; when "yes", same as the -s option.
#
#	Perform stemming (suffix stripping) on words during searches.  Words
#	that end in the wildcard character are not stemmed.

#StopWordFile		custom_stop_word_file
#
# used by: index, extract; same as the -s option.
#
#	The name of a file containing the set of stop-words to use instead of
#	the built-in set.

#StoreWordPositions	yes
#
# used by: index; when "no", same as the -P option.
#
#	Store word positions during indexing needed to do "near" searches.
#	Storing said data approximately doubles the size of the generated
#	index.

#TempDirectory		/tmp
#
# used by: index
#
#	Directory to use for temporary files during indexing.  If your OS
#	mounts swap space on /tmp, as indexing progresses and more files get
#	created in /tmp, you will have less swap space, indexing will get
#	slower, and you may run out of memory.  If this is the case, you can
#	specify a directory on a real filesystem, i.e., one on a physical
#	disk.  The directory must exist.

#ThreadsMin		5
#ThreadsMax		100
#
# used by: search; same as the -t or -T option, respectively.
#
#	The minimum/maximum number of simultanous threads, respectively; used
#	only when SearchDaemon is not "none".

#ThreadTimeout		30
#
# used by: search; same as the -O option.
#
#	Number of seconds until an idle spare thread times out and destroys
#	itself; used only when SearchDaemon is not "none".

#TitleLines		100
#
# used by: index; same as the -t option.
#
#	For HTML and XHTML files only, the maximum number of lines into a file
#	to look at for HTML and XHTML <TITLE> tags.  The default is 100.
#	Larger numbers slow indexing.

#Verbosity		0
#
# used by: index, extract; same as the -v option.
#
#	Print additional information to standard output during indexing or
#	extraction.  The verbosity levels are 0-4; see index(1) or extract(1)
#	for details.

#WordFilesMax		infinity
#
# used by: index; same as the -f option.
#
#	The maximum number of files a word may occur in before it is discarded
#	as being too frequent.  The default is infinity.

#WordPercentMax		100
#
# used by: index; same as the -p option.
#
#	The maximum percentage of files a word may occur in before it is
#	discarded as being too frequent.  If you want to keep all words
#	regardless, specify 101.

#WordsNear		10
#
# used by: search; same as the -n option.
#
#	The maximum number of words apart two words can be to be considered
#	"near" each other.

#WordThreshold		4000000
#
# used by: index; same as the -W option.
#
#	The word count past which partial indicies are generated and merged
#	since all the words are too big to fit into memory at the same time.
#	If you index and your machine begins to swap like mad, lower this
#	value.  The above works OK in a 1GB machine.  A rule of thumb is to add
#	4000000 words for each additional GB of RAM you have.  These numbers
#	are for a SPARC machine running Solaris.  Other machines running other
#	operating systems use memory differently.  You simply have to
#	experiment.  Only the super-user can specify a value larger than the
#	compiled-in default.
